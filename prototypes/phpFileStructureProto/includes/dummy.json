The first known incident involving this new rule involved Damon Wayans who used the word 16 times in a 20-minute show. He was fined $320 ($20 for each offense) and given a 3-month ban from the club.\nThe ban actually lasted just a month as he was back performing in January.\nCharity fundraisers have been held at the club, including benefit nights for the Red Cross, USO, <i>Cops For Causes</i>, <i>Comics Without Borders</i>, <i>Wounded Warriors</i>, <i>Middle Eastern Comedy Fest</i>, and <i>Stand Up For Pakistan</i>.",
